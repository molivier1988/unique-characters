# Unique

Does string contain unique characters

## Description

Using array methods, determine whether a string contains unique characters. If yes return **true** else return **false**

## Reflections

I thought I was struggling with the understanding the logic for this exercise but actually was in the general ball park with the conditional if statement.

Essentially as the we iterate through the array indexOf() and lastIndexOf() retrive the first and last index of each character in a string. If these 2 values are not equal then the function returns false meaning that the string **does not contain unique characters** else function returns true meaning the string **does contain unique characters**
